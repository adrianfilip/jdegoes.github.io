I'm an author, speaker, entrepreneur, and long-time software architect and engineer. I love startups, technology, science, software engineering, fitness, and my family.

I've blogged on and off since 2000. Mostly off. This is my most recent attempt, fueled by my desire to write articles in Markdown and publish using Git.

At some point, I should probably put my resume on this page. Until then, you can find something that vaguely resembles a resume on [LinkedIn]({{ site.owner.linkedin }}).
