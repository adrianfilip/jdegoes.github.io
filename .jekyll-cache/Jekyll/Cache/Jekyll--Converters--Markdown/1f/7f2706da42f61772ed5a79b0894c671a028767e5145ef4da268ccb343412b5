I"ë<p>On January 13th, Balaji Srinivasanâ€”a successful entrepreneur, a board
partner at Andreesson Horowitz, and the current CEO of <a href="https://21.co">21.co</a>â€”
mysteriously and unexpectedly deleted all of his tweets.</p>

<p>In their place, he posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/820139852041777152">single tweet</a>
to his 50,000 followers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donâ€™t argue on Twitter.</p>

  <p>Build the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Srinivasan is well-respected in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Heâ€™s smart, knowledgable, accomplished, and possesses a keen ability to see
through bullshit. Yet Balaji retains an unspoiled passion for improving the human
condition through science and technologyâ€”a obvious theme of his <a href="https://www.counsyl.com">earlier
startup</a> in the health care space.</p>

<p>Personally, since Balaji stumbled onto my own timeline, Iâ€™ve learned much from
his tweets on technology, politics, and society.</p>

<p>When Balaji quit Twitter, it was a shock to me and countless others. Speculation
abounded, but all discussions seemed to center on a rumor that Balaji was being
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/trump-said-to-consider-another-thiel-associate-to-lead-fda">considered by Trump to head up the FDA</a>, an idea I find <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/18/watch-new-health-picks/">incredibly attractive</a>.</p>

<p>Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-did-trumps-top-fda-pick-delete-all-his-tweets-1791227569">speculated</a>
that Mr. Srinivasan deleted his tweets because he had previously posted
unflattering tweets about Trump. Recode, <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/14/14276530/balaji-srinivasan-trump-fda-twitter-andreessen-horowitz">in much harsher words</a>, argued that Balajiâ€™s outspoken criticism of the FDA was to blame.</p>

<p>Personally, I have a different theory about why Balaji quit Twitter: he quit
because <a href="/articles/fuck-twitter">Twitterâ€™s fucked</a>.</p>

<p>The medium is custom-designed to signal virtue and vice. If you arenâ€™t into
either of those, then you can share links and cute cat pics, but thatâ€™s about it.</p>

<p>In particular, if your goal is to inform and persuade, to use reason and data to
bring about the change you want to see in the world, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">long-form</a> beats the
living shit out of short-form.</p>

<p>In what may be Balajiâ€™s smartest move to date, heâ€™s basically said heâ€™s done
trying to change the world 140 characters at a time (a strategy that can never
work). Instead, heâ€™s going to build the future with his own two hands.</p>

<p>People can talk trash to you on Twitter all day long, but itâ€™s impossible to
argue with the enormous power of actual change. The real mystery is not why
Balaji quit Twitter, but why more people <em>havenâ€™t</em>.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on Mr. Srinivasan. While heâ€™s gone from Twitter, my guess is that
the impact he will have on the world is just getting started.</p>
