I"<p>I sat on a sturdy wooden chair at one of my favorite shops, sipping a black coffee and listening patiently as a fellow entrepreneur described where he was at with his business.</p>

<p>As he described his product, and the challenges they were having, I flashed back to <a href="https://degoes.net/articles/precog-lessons-learned/">my days at Precog</a>.</p>

<p>If I was correct, he was <em>about</em> to learn many of the same lessons that <em>I</em> learned, in the same way I learned them: <em>slowly</em> and <em>painfully</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, there was a stark difference between what I was <em>thinking</em>, and what I was <em>saying</em>.</p>

<p>My brain was saying, <em>“Watch out!”</em> But my head was nodding in agreement. All I could offer were feeble platitudes like <em>“That makes sense to me”</em>.</p>

<p>As the conflict raged, I kept justifying my behavior.</p>

<p><em>I like this entrepreneur.</em></p>

<p><em>I should be nice to people I like.</em></p>

<p><em>It would be mean to suggest there are serious issues with the startup he’s poured his life into.</em></p>

<p>Those justifications prevailed, but I left our chat feeling uneasy about the choice I made.</p>

<h2 id="being-nice">Being “Nice”</h2>

<p>In early-stage fund-raising, you’re told <em>no</em> a lot.</p>

<p>Being told <em>no</em> never really bothered me.</p>

<p>What <em>did</em> bother me, however, were the investors who gave me some bullshit reason for not investing, like <em>“There’s no fit,”</em> or <em>“You’re too early stage for us,”</em> or <em>“We’re too busy to make an investment right now”</em> (usually a few weeks prior to announcing another investment!).</p>

<p>It bothered me because I genuinely wanted to know <em>why</em>, so I could evaluate and use that information to make my business <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>Was I chasing a stupid dream? Was I attacking the market in a foolish way? Was revenue too low? Were my reference customers the wrong ones for a business like mine?</p>

<p>For most investors, I’d never know what they were <em>really</em> thinking, because they were too <em>“nice”</em> to tell me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Later that day, after much introspection, I came to a sad conclusion:</p>

<p><em>I didn’t offer honest feedback because I wanted the entrepreneur to <strong>like me</strong> more than I wanted to <strong>help him succeed</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Apparently, I reflected, I’d rather see someone lose everything they’ve worked to build than risk being seen as unkind.</p>

<p>That’s the essence of being <em>“nice”</em>.</p>

<p>“Nice” is all about <em>me</em>, not the other person. “Nice” is about <em>wanting to be liked</em> by someone more than <em>wanting to help</em> that person.</p>

<h2 id="being-nice-1">Being <em>Nice</em></h2>

<p>That day, I resolved to change. No more Mr “Nice” Guy.</p>

<p>I’m going to tell the fucking truth, even when…no, <em>especially when</em> it’s unpleasant.</p>

<p>Because ultimately, being <em>genuinely nice</em> is about <em>helping people achieve their goals</em>, not about <em>trying to be likable</em>.</p>

<p>That’s what I want from others. So that’s what I’m going to <em>give</em> others.</p>

<p>Say hello to Mr <em>Nice</em> Guy.</p>

<hr />

<p>I followed up with the entrepreneur, and shared my honest thoughts — not in a mean way, but in a constructive way.</p>

<p>I had prepared myself for the fallout. After all, even <em>implying</em> that someone is making potentially serious mistakes is enough to piss most people off for good.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, in this case, it had the opposite effect. We’re closer now than before, and hopefully he is better equipped to deal with the challenges he’s going to face.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not always going to turn out so well. In fact, I expect most people to dislike me for being honest.</p>

<p>But no matter, because I’ve learned my lesson.</p>

<p>Being <em>genuinely nice</em> means I have to stop being “nice”, and just tell the fucking truth already.</p>
