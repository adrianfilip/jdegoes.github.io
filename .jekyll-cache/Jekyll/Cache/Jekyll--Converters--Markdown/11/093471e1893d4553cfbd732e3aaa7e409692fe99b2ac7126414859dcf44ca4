I"<p><em>Code of Conducts</em> are one of the most divisive issues in all of tech: some
people vehemently reject them as unnecessary or even nefarious; others extoll
their virtues and refuse to participate in communities without them.</p>

<p>Personally, I see COCs differently than most people. I view a COC as serving
two functions that I find useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Setting expectations for participants;</li>
  <li>Holding leaders of a community accountable to prior commitments.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we participate in different communities that we don‚Äôt control, there‚Äôs
always a possibility we‚Äôll be thrown out because of who we are or what we do. A
COC, then, can help inform people under what circumstances they will be allowed
to participate in the community, so they can make informed decisions and aren‚Äôt
surprised by whatever happens.</p>

<p>A COC is also useful to hold community leaders accountable to standards of
consistency. Of course, community leaders can refuse to uphold their
commitments, but most people <em>do</em> make a strong effort to act consistently with
prior commitments. Getting those commitments out in the open for all to see
does, I believe, help ensure their consistent enforcement.</p>

<p>For that reason, I‚Äôm a fan of COCs, which is why
<a href="https://lambdaconf.us">LambdaConf</a> has had a COC since I first learned of them.</p>

<p>That said, not all COCs are created equal.</p>

<p>Many COCs are so vague, they do not create clear expectations for attendees. In
fact, community leaders can use these vague COCs to kick out anyone they don‚Äôt
like, under grounds their behavior is ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù, ‚Äúharmful‚Äù, ‚Äúnot empathic‚Äù, or
simply not ‚Äúbest for the community‚Äù.</p>

<p>Most COCs offer protection against discrimination, but only on certain
dimensions. For example, the average COC does not protect against discrimination
for political or philosophical views ‚Äî which means that, for example, atheists
like myself can be discriminated against or banned on grounds of their views,
but Christians or Muslims cannot be similarly banned for their religious views.</p>

<p>Similarly, a Republican or Democrat could be discriminated against or banned for
their political affiliation, which seems rather arbitrary to me (why protect
a religion but not a political affiliation?).</p>

<p>These drawbacks are not insurmountable. I believe it‚Äôs possible to create a
code of conduct that is not vague, and which offers uniform protections.</p>

<p>In fact, I and others have been working on precisely such a code of conduct,
under the umbrella of <a href="https://fantasyland.institute">Fantasyland Institute of Learning</a>,
a non-profit I help run that is dedicated to improving the way the world
develops software.</p>

<p>The code of conduct is not designed for just <em>any</em> community. Rather, it‚Äôs
designed for <em>professional</em> communities ‚Äî¬†that is, communities of individuals
united by a shared professional interest, but otherwise quite diverse in all
possible respects.</p>

<p>This code of conduct, called <em>Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of
Professionalism</em> (FCOP), is designed to help ensure productivity and inclusion
within professional communities in a pluralistic society. As such, FCOP is not
intended to impose any system of politics, morals, or values onto members.</p>

<p>This is useful in a purely professional context, but is wholly unsuitable for
many other types of communities (support groups, churches, etc.).</p>

<p>The short-form of FCOP is shown below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWe welcome all peaceful people to participate in the Community. We do not allow Discrimination, Stereotyping, Harassment, Judgmental Communication, or violations of privacy. We do not exclude any peaceful people from our Community unless they have demonstrated an inability to follow our terms and conditions.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the five pillars of FCOP:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No Discrimination</strong>. Everyone is protected from discrimination.</li>
  <li><strong>No Stereotyping</strong>. Everyone is protected from stereotyping.</li>
  <li><strong>No Harassment</strong>. All interaction requires mutual consent.</li>
  <li><strong>No Judgmental Communication</strong>. People must communicate without imposing
 their morality or values onto others.</li>
  <li><strong>No Privacy Violations</strong>. People aren‚Äôt allowed to dox, name &amp; shame, pry,
 otherwise share personal details they learn about in the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>FCOP is still under active development, but you can check out a draft
version on <a href="https://github.com/fantasylandinst/fcop">the official repository</a>.</p>

<p>When FCOP is complete, Fantasyland Institute of Learning will adopt the COC for
all professional events and within all online communities.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs my hope that FCOP will see broader usage within the tech industry, both
within open source projects, and within all manner of professional meetups and
events like <a href="https://lambdaconf.us">LambdaConf</a>. While not appropriate for many
kinds of communities, those with purely professional goals may find some value.</p>
